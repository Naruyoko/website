You are here.
Speaking to the garbage.
If you wish to hear it,
Here's a story that I can tell.

You are facing great door
Which never opens.
There are eleven slots
Which has no gap;
There are keys for it,
And you have type of it.
To unlock the door,
You must find them all.

They are in a city,
Which layouted in grids.
While it is vast out there,
It fits in your hands.

4 of the keys are at the west.
They controls,
And shifts,
And escapes,
And switch between tasks.
They are the supreme
Of all of the city.

You see twelve blocks,
Which can do the job.
Although not the supreme,
It lies at the top.
You can count them.
Find them.
Sort them.
And the key is given,
When you check for the erorr.

Of the buildings
Some are different.
And despite they're in weird shapes,
It's is useful than all others.
Find two of them.
It's at the south and the east.
It should be easy,
So you must find it quick

You have to go through.
Ask them, they'll tell you the way.
Right now, you have one place to go.
The destination; The future.

Now go to the capitals.
It is unorganized
Because there are many people.
Ask the vice president.
He isn't much popular,
But rather normal.
Ask for the most popular person.
Go ask for them, too.
Good? Okay.

One more key
Until we unlock the door.
You may know.
In Latin you say this.
It is in 10^27.
Do it. Now.

Alright.
You did it.
Now.

Reflect yourself.
Reflect what you've done.
And...
The door, should be open.
In order to reveal the secret.
I'll wait for an eternity.

...
You did it.
Now, say the password.
I hid it.
Where if anything changes,
It logs it.
Please break the barrier.
Can't you hear me crying?
Maybe not.
Because I can't cry.
Now, say it.
Say, "IGo************************."
sys>This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
sys>Encrypting with hexecontatetrimal . . .
sys>Encryption complete.

Yeah, it's weird, right?
Now, get out from here.
You are too worthy to be here.
